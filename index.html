These modern heterogeneous systems features multiple layers of memory hierarchies, and produce a high degree of thread-level parallelism. To ensure that current and future applications perform well on these systems, it is important that users be able to cleanly express the various types of parallelism found in their applications while trusting that expertly-implemented runtime libraries will schedule this parallelism in a way that efficiently utilizes the memory hierarchies and computational resources of their system.</p>

	<p> In this poster we present our work-in-progress, a distributed, heterogeneous programming model in HabaneroUPC++, which aims to target distributed, heterogeneous systems with multi-layered memory hierarchies through a distributed data-driven programming model that integrates all memory layers together through data-flow programming.

	<div id="p7" style="display:none;"><i> <p>Due to the increasing power constraints and higher and higher performance demands, many vendors have shifted their focus from designing high-performance computer nodes using powerful multicore general-purpose CPUs, to nodes containing a smaller number of general-purpose CPUs aided by a larger number of more power-efficient special purpose processing units, such as GPUs, FPGAs or DSPs. While offering a lower power-to-performance ratio, unfortunately, such heterogeneous systems are notoriously hard to program, forcing the users to resort to lower-level direct programming of the special purpose processors and manually managing data transfer and synchronization between the parts of the program running on general-purpose CPUs and on special-purpose processors.</p>

	<p>In this paper, we present HC-K2H, a programming model and runtime system for the Texas Instruments Keystone II Hawking platform, consisting of 4 ARM CPUs and 8 TI DSP processors. This System-on-a-Chip (SoC) offers high floating-point performance with lower power requirements than other processors with comparable performance. We present the design and implementation of a hybrid programming model and work-stealing runtime that allows tasks to be created and executed on both the ARM and DSP, and enables the seamless execution and synchronization of tasks regardless of whether they are running on the ARM or DSP. The design of our programming model and runtime is based on an extension of the Habanero C programming system. We evaluate our implementation using task-parallel benchmarks on a Hawking board, and demonstrate excellent scaling compared to sequential implementations on a single ARM processor.</p></i></li>

	<div id="p6" style="display:none;"><i> <p>The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming models combine shared and distributed memory features, providing the basis for high performance and high productivity parallel programming environments. UPC++ is a very recent PGAS implementation that takes a library-based approach and avoids the complexities associated with compiler transformations. However, this implementation does not support dynamic task parallelism and only relies on other threading models (e.g., OpenMP or pthreads) for exploiting parallelism within a PGAS place. </p>

	<p>In this paper, we introduce a compiler-free PGAS library called Habanero-UPC++, which supports a tighter integration of intra-place and inter-place parallelism than standard hybrid programming approaches. The library makes heavy use of C++11 lambda functions in its APIs. C++11 lambdas avoid the need for compiler support while still retaining the syntactic convenience of language-based approaches. The  Habanero-UPC+ library implementation is based on a tight integration of the UPC++ library and the Habanero-C++ library, with new extensions to support the integration. The UPC++ library is used to provide PGAS communication and function shipping support using GASNet, and the Habanero-C++ library is used to provide support for intra-place work-stealing integrated with function shipping. We demonstrate the programmability and performance of our implementation using two benchmarks, scaled up to 6000 cores. The insights developed in this paper promise to further enhance the usability and popularity of PGAS programming models.</p></i></li>

	<div id="p5" style="display:none;"><i> <p> This paper addresses the problem of efficiently supporting parallelism within a managed runtime. A popular approach for exploiting software parallelism on parallel hardware is task parallelism, where the programmer explicitly identifies potential parallelism and the runtime then schedules the work. Work-stealing is a promising scheduling strategy that a runtime may use to keep otherwise idle hardware busy while relieving overloaded hardware of its burden. However, work stealing comes with substantial overheads. Recent work identified sequential overheads of work-stealing, those that occur even when no stealing takes place, as a significant source of overhead. That work was able to reduce sequential overheads to just 15%.</p>

<p> In this work, we turn to dynamic overheads, those that occur each time a steal takes place. We show that the dynamic overhead is dominated by introspection of the victim’s stack when a steal takes place. We exploit the idea of a low overhead return barrier to reduce the dynamic overhead by approximately half, resulting in total performance improvements of as much as 20%. Because, unlike prior work, we attack the overheads directly due to stealing and therefore attack the overheads that grow as parallelism grows, we improve the scalability of work-stealing applications. This result is complementary to recent work addressing the sequential overheads of work-stealing. This work therefore substantially relieves work-stealing of the increasing pressure due to increasing intranode hardware parallelism.

Work-stealing is proven to be a promising approach for productively exploiting the software parallelism on these modern hardware. Despite the benefits, work-stealing approach incur some form of overheads as a necessary side effect of their implementation.</p>

	<p> The contributions of this thesis are as following: a) identifies key sources of overheads in work-stealing scheduler, namely sequential and dynamic overhead; b) it proposes several novel techniques to reduce these overheads; c) evaluates the design using a range of benchmarks, and a variety of work-stealing implementations; and d) to ease the use of this high performance runtime, provides extensions to the Java programming language that integrates annotations for work-stealing and annotations for data-centric concurrency control.</p>

	<p> Our new design can reduce the sequential overheads to just 15% and almost halves the dynamic overhead, leading to substantial performance improvements. These results and our insight into the sources of overhead for work-stealing implementations give further hope to an already promising technique for exploiting increasingly available hardware parallelism.</i></p>

A programmer who uses work-stealing explicitly identifies potential parallelism and the runtime then schedules work, keep- ing otherwise idle hardware busy while relieving overloaded hardware of its burden. However, work-stealing comes with substantial overheads. Our prior work has demonstrated that using the exception handling mechanism of modern VMs and gathering the runtime information directly from the victims execution stack can significantly reduce these overheads. A return barrier is a mechanism for intercepting the popping of a stack frame, and thus is a powerful tool for optimizing mechanisms that involve scanning of stack state.</p>
	<p> In this paper we identify the overhead associated with managing the work-stealing related information on a victim’s execution stack. We present the design and preliminary findings of using return barriers on a victim’s execution stack to reduce these overheads. We evaluate our design using classical work-stealing benchmarks. On these bench- marks, compared to our prior design, we are able to reduce the overheads by as much as 58%.

A programmer who uses work-stealing explicitly identifies potential parallelism and the runtime then schedules work, keep- ing otherwise idle hardware busy while relieving overloaded hardware of its burden. Prior work has demonstrated that work-stealing is very effective in practice. However, work- stealing comes with a substantial overhead: as much as 2× to 12× slowdown over orthodox sequential code.</p>
<p>In this paper we identify the key sources of overhead in work-stealing schedulers and present two significant refinements to their implementation. We evaluate our work- stealing designs using a range of benchmarks, four different work-stealing implementations, including the popular fork-join framework, and a range of architectures. On these benchmarks, compared to orthodox sequential Java, our fastest design has an overhead of just 15%. By contrast, fork-join has a 2.3× overhead and the previous implementation of the system we use has an overhead of 4.1×. These results and our insight into the sources of overhead for work- stealing implementations give further hope to an already promising technique for exploiting increasingly available hardware parallelism.</p>

<div id="p1" style="display:none;"><i> <p>The use of a work stealing scheduler has become a popular approach for providing task parallelism. It is used in many modern parallel programming languages, such as Cilk and X10, which have emerged to address the concerns of parallel programming complexity on modern multicore architectures. </p>
	<p>There are various challenges in providing an efficient implementation of work-stealing, but in any implementation it must be possible for the thief to access the execution state required to per- form the stolen task. The natural way to achieve this is to save the necessary state whenever a producer creates stealable work. While the ability to provide some degree of parallelism may dominate performance at scale, it is common for the vast majority of potentially stealable work to never actually be stolen, but instead processed by the producer itself. This indicates that to further improve performance we should minimize the overheads incurred in making work available for stealing. </p>
	<p>We are not the only ones to make this observation, for example X10's current C++ work-stealing implementation stack-allocates state objects and lazily copies them to the heap to avoid unnecessary heap allocation during normal execution. In our context of a Java virtual machine, it is possible to extend this idea further and avoid stack allocating state objects, but instead allow thieves to ex- tract state directly from within stack frames of the producer. This is achieved by using state-map information provided by a cooperative runtime compiler, allowing us to drive down the cost of making state available for stealable work items. We discuss our design and preliminary findings for the implementation of our framework in- side X10 work-stealing runtime and the baseline compiler of Jikes RVM, a high-performance Java research virtual machine. </p> </i></div></p></li>
